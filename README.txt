righack - swiss army knife for ham radios

This is a work in progress. Really I'm just publishing my own experiments.
Things may change at any time. Nothing is guranteed. With out
any other communication with me there will be no attempt to avoid
breaking others.

This software is being created by Tyler Riddle KG7OEM <cardboardaardvark@gmail.com>.
The current license is GPL3 but I'm not sure I will stick with it in the long
term. Contributions are welcome but any patch submitted for inclusion in the
project must include a statement that a future license change is ok. See
doc/CONTRIBUTING.txt for information.

This project includes some third party software that is licensed under
different terms. This software may include local modifications. See the
src/external directory for this source code.
