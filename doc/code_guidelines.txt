MEMORY MANAGEMENT

  1. If the caller of the function is responsible for freeing the memory that
     is returned and they only need to use free() then the function name
     must have a suffix of __a for allocated.

     For example: char * string_copy__a(const char *)

  2. If the caller of the function is responsible for freeing the memory that
     is returned and they need to use a specific function to do it then the
     function names must come in pairs with a suffix of _create and _destroy.

     Example:
       struct some_thing * some_thing_create(void)
       void some_thing_destroy(struct some_thing *)
